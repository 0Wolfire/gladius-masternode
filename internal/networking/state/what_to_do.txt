when a request is made for an unknown route:
    proxy the request for the user and then fetch the content from the masternode and convert it to gladius template format. fetch linked resources as well.
    notify the p2p network that there is new content that needs to be cached by edge nodes.
    add a route(or routes) entry in the cache but leave the seeders field empty. this will cause subsequent requests to be proxied until the content is distributed and network state refreshed with which nodes have this content.
    continue proxying the requests for the same resource until the next network state refresh provides the nodes that are hosting the content.
