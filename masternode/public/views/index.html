    <p class="lead">This page is the first website running on the Gladius Network, all non-text content on this page was loaded from a Gladius edge node. That means all the Javascript, images, and CSS came from a beta tester running the Gladius software near you! </p>

      In its current form, the Gladius network looks like this: Image Here The way this works is first you are connected to a masternode (You're connected to this one: ) and then that informs your browser what edge node would be best to load content from (that
      node's proximity to you being the primary factor). In fact, you are [miles from node] away from the node you are connected to. But before any of this content is loaded into your browser, we verify it by checking the hash of the file against what
      we say it should be (you can read more about hashing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function">here</a>); this stops potentially malicious actors from sending you content you don't want or that may compromise your browser. For reference, the hash we expected was [expected] and the files you got hash to [actual].
